# Meeting02


>Meeting02 will cover some basics for installing and running Ansible playbooks. We will breifly look at simple inventories, variables, templates, and playbooks. I have tried to introduce simple tasks with some semi-advanced options to keep everyone interested. 


### Preparation

Since you are here, you have already figured out most of the prep. The only thing left is to create your environment. Running the command below will create a docker container with the name you define. You can use this envrinment to run the rest of the labs.

```
lab make_up_name
```
You should see a mesage like the one below. If it doesn't say "new container" then you might want to pick another name.
```
[root@fwac ansible]# lab make_up_name

Created new container named make_up_name

[root@make_up_name make_up_name]#

```

You are now ready to run your labs. You are already in the docker container and can do whatever you want without causing any damage. You will be in a working directory that is shared to the fwac server so all your work will be saved.

## Lab 1 - Install Ansible

Installing Ansible is easy with the proper setup. We will review the configuration and you will install ansible using one of the two following methods
```
yum -y install ansible
```
>or

```
pip install ansible
```

---
## Lab 2 - Inventory

We are going to start with super simple inventory and then add a little as we go. `vi inventory` and add the content below to the file, then `:wq` to save. 

```
[fwac]
10.0.0.1

[fwac:vars]

```
That's about as simple as it gets. `fwac` is a server group, with a single server `10.0.0.1` as a member. We can now create a playbook to reference this group.

---
## Lab 3 - Playbook

We are going to break the playbook down into sections to understand everything that is happening. We are covering a lot of functionality in the few tasks we setup. In this lab we are adding the docker host to the fwac server /etc/hosts. This adds your host into DNS.

#### Getting started
Playbooks are defined using YAML. A YAML file should begin with the first line containing `---` and nothing else. Once you define the file as YAML, you can start defining the key value pairs that build the playbook for Ansible to interpret.


`vi playbook.yml` and add the following lines
```
---
- hosts: fwac
  tasks:
  - local_action: shell hostname
    register: host
    when: myhost is not defined
  - debug:
      var: host
      verbosity: 2
```

Save the playbook `:wq` and run it like this:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml -vv
```

**Notes:**

- The `hosts` line uses the inventory group to define the hosts to run the tasks. 
- The indentation and `-` are all part of the syntax 
- `local_action` tells ansible to run this task on the localhost
- `register` is used to capture the output from the task
- `when` is a conditional expression
- `debug` prints the variable value


Add the following snip after the above tasks. Make sure the spacing is the same and stuff lines up.

```
  - local_action: shell hostname -i
    register: ip
    when: myip is not defined
  - debug:
      var: ip
      verbosity: 2
```

**What we've done:**

- Define default variables
- Use conditional expression to allow override
- Add debug output


Now for the task that runs on the fwac server
```
  - lineinfile:
      path: /etc/hosts
      regexp: "^{{ myip|default(ip.stdout) }}"
      line: "{{ myip|default(ip.stdout) }}      {{ myhost|default(host.stdout) }}"
      state: present
```

- Run the playbook multiple times. Ansible is meant to be idempotent
- Experiment by adding `myip` and `myhost` definitions in the inventory
- Try changing the `state` to `absent`
- Run the playbook with different levels of verbosity

---
## Lab 4 - Run against other hosts

Create another entry in your inventory called `labs` and list some of the hostname added to /etc/hosts. Once you have a new group defined in inventory you can do whatever you want. Some ideas are listed below. If you want to try creating a template, you should create one with a unique name and define some variables in the `[labs:vars]` section of inventory. Ansible will look in a directory named templates/ relative to the playbook. 


```
- hosts: labs
  tasks:
  - template:
    src: changeme.j2
    dest: /etc/changeme.conf
  - yum:
      name: httpd
      state: latest
```
