# Meeting02

Meeting02 will cover some basics for installing and running Ansible playbooks. We will breifly look at simple inventories, variables, templates, and playbooks. 

## Preparation

Since you are here, you have already figured out most of the prep. The only thing left is to create your environment. Running the command below will create a docker container with the name you define. You can use this envrinment to run the rest of the labs.

```
lab make_up_name
```
You should see a mesage like the one below. If it doesn't say "new container" then you might want to pick another name.
```
[root@fwac ansible]# lab make_up_name

Created new container named make_up_name

[root@make_up_name make_up_name]#

```
You are now ready to run your labs. You are already in the docker container and can do whatever you want without causing any damage. You will be in a working directory that is shared to the fwac server so all your work will be saved.

## Lab 1 - Install Ansible

Installing Ansible is easy with the proper setup. We will review the configuration and you will install ansible using one of the two following methods
```
yum -y install ansible
```
or
```
pip install ansible
```

## Lab 2 - Inventory

We are going to start with super simple inventory and then add a little as we go. `vi inventory` and add the content below to the file, then `:wq` to save. 

```
[fwac]
10.0.0.1
```
That's about as simple as it gets. `fwac` is a server group, with a single server `10.0.0.1` as a member. We can now create a playbook to reference this group.

## Lab 3 - Playbook

We are going to break the playbook down into sections to understand everything that is happening. We are covering a lot of functionality in the few tasks we setup. In this lab we are adding the docker host to the fwac server /etc/hosts. This adds your host into DNS.

### Getting started
Playbooks are defined using YAML. A YAML file should begin with the first line containing `---` and nothing else. Once you define the file as YAML, you can start defining the key value pairs that build the playbook for Ansible to interpret.

      regexp: "{{ host.stdout }}"
      line: "{{ ip.stdout }} {{ host.stdout }}"
